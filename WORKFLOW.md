## 🔍 **Detailed Step-by-Step Workflow**

### **Phase 1: Ticket Ingestion** 📝

#### **Step 1.1: Customer Submission**
```
INPUT: Customer fills form in Streamlit UI
├── Subject: "Can't reset my password - urgent help needed"
├── Message: "Hi, I'm trying to reset my password but..."
├── Customer Name: "Sarah Johnson"
├── Email: "sarah.j@company.com"
└── Customer ID: Generated/Provided
```

#### **Step 1.2: Ticket Creation**
```python
# FastAPI Backend Processing
ticket = CustomerTicket(
    id=generate_uuid(),
    customer_id="sarah.j@company.com",
    subject="Can't reset my password - urgent help needed",
    message="Hi, I'm trying to reset my password but...",
    customer_name="Sarah Johnson",
    status=TicketStatus.NEW,
    created_at=datetime.now()
)
```

#### **Step 1.3: Workflow Initialization**
```python
# LangGraph State Initialization
initial_state = {
    "ticket": ticket,
    "classification": {},
    "knowledge_results": [],
    "escalation_decision": {},
    "resolution": {},
    "workflow_status": "started"
}
```

---

### **Phase 2: AI Classification** 🤖

#### **Step 2.1: Classifier Agent Analysis**
```python
# Classifier Agent Processing
async def classify_ticket(ticket):
    # 1. LLM Analysis
    llm_result = await gemini_llm.classify_ticket(
        subject=ticket.subject,
        message=ticket.message
    )
    
    # 2. Rule-based Enhancement
    adjusted_result = apply_classification_rules(ticket, llm_result)
    
    # 3. Confidence Scoring
    return ClassificationResult(
        category=TicketCategory.ACCOUNT,     # ✅ Detected: password-related
        priority=TicketPriority.HIGH,       # ✅ Detected: "urgent" keyword
        confidence=0.87,                     # ✅ High confidence
        reasoning="Password reset with urgency indicators"
    )
```

#### **Step 2.2: Classification Logic**
```
🧠 LLM Analysis:
├── Text Processing: Extract key phrases, intent, sentiment
├── Category Detection: account/technical/billing/general/product
├── Priority Assessment: low/medium/high/critical
└── Confidence Calculation: 0.0 - 1.0

🔧 Rule Enhancement:
├── Keyword Matching: "urgent", "critical", "broken" → Priority ↑
├── Security Detection: "hack", "breach" → Priority = Critical
├── Category Rules: billing + "refund" → Priority ↑
└── Final Adjustment: Combine LLM + Rules
```

---

### **Phase 3: Knowledge Base Search** 📚

#### **Step 3.1: Knowledge Agent Processing**
```python
# Knowledge Agent Workflow
async def search_knowledge_base(ticket, classification):
    # 1. Query Preparation
    search_query = prepare_search_query(ticket, classification)
    # Result: "password reset account urgent help"
    
    # 2. Embedding Generation
    query_embedding = await mxbai_embeddings.encode_text(search_query)
    # Result: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...] (1024 dimensions)
    
    # 3. Hybrid Search (Text + Vector)
    results = await elasticsearch.hybrid_search(
        query_text=search_query,
        query_embedding=query_embedding,
        category="account",  # Filter by classification
        top_k=5
    )
    
    return enhanced_results
```

#### **Step 3.2: Vector Search Process**
```
🔍 Search Strategy:
├── 📝 Text Search: Match keywords in title/content
├── 🧠 Vector Search: Semantic similarity using embeddings
├── 🏷️ Category Filter: Only "account" articles
└── 📊 Hybrid Scoring: Combine text + vector scores

📊 Search Results:
├── Article KB-001: "How to Reset Your Password" (Score: 0.94)
├── Article KB-006: "Two-Factor Authentication Setup" (Score: 0.73)
├── Article KB-013: "Account Verification Process" (Score: 0.68)
└── Enhanced with popularity/rating boosts
```

#### **Step 3.3: Result Enhancement**
```python
# Result Enhancement Logic
for result in search_results:
    # Category match boost
    if result.category == classification.category:
        result.score *= 1.2
    
    # Popularity boost (usage-based)
    if result.resolution_count > 50:
        result.score *= 1.1
    
    # Rating boost
    if result.rating > 4.0:
        result.score *= 1.05
```

### **Phase 4: Escalation Decision** 🔄

#### **Step 4.1: Escalation Agent Analysis**
```python
# Escalation Agent Decision Process
async def evaluate_escalation(ticket, classification, kb_results):
    # 1. LLM Analysis
    llm_decision = await gemini_llm.check_escalation({
        "subject": ticket.subject,
        "message": ticket.message,
        "category": classification.category,
        "priority": classification.priority
    })
    
    # 2. Rule-based Logic
    rule_decision = apply_escalation_rules(ticket, classification, kb_results)
    
    # 3. Combined Decision
    return combine_decisions(llm_decision, rule_decision)
```

#### **Step 4.2: Escalation Rules Matrix**
```
🚨 Auto-Escalation Triggers:
├── 🔴 Critical Priority: Always escalate
├── 😡 Angry Customer: "manager", "supervisor", "complain"
├── 🔒 Security Issues: "hack", "breach", "fraud"
├── ⚖️ Legal Matters: "legal", "lawsuit", "lawyer"
├── 💰 Billing Disputes: "refund" + high amounts
├── 🔧 Complex Technical: No good KB matches + high priority
└── 🔄 Repeat Issues: "tried multiple times", "contacted before"

✅ AI Resolution Criteria:
├── 📚 Good KB Match: Score > 0.7
├── 🎯 Clear Category: High classification confidence
├── 😊 Neutral Sentiment: No frustration indicators
├── 📋 Standard Request: Common, well-documented issues
└── 🤖 High AI Confidence: Combined confidence > 0.6
```

#### **Step 4.3: Decision Example (Password Reset)**
```
📊 Escalation Analysis:
├── ✅ Priority: HIGH (but not CRITICAL)
├── ✅ KB Match: Excellent (0.94 score for password reset)
├── ✅ Sentiment: Neutral (no anger keywords)
├── ✅ Complexity: Standard request
├── ✅ AI Confidence: High (0.87)
└── 🎯 DECISION: NO ESCALATION - AI can handle this

Subject: Re: Can't reset my password - urgent help needed

Dear Sarah,

Thank you for contacting us about your password reset issue. I understand how frustrating this can be, especially when you need urgent access to your account.

I've reviewed your request and can help you resolve this immediately. Here's what I recommend:

1. **Clear your browser cache and cookies** - This often resolves reset email delivery issues
2. **Check your spam/junk folder** - Reset emails sometimes get filtered
3. **Try a different browser or incognito mode** - This bypasses any extension conflicts
4. **Ensure you're using the correct email address** associated with your account

If the reset email still doesn't arrive after trying these steps:
- Wait 15 minutes between reset attempts
- Try the reset process from our mobile app if available
- Contact us again if the issue persists

Your password reset should work immediately after following these steps. Most customers resolve this issue with the first few suggestions.

Please let me know if you need any additional assistance!

Best regards,
Customer Support Team

Ticket Reference: TKT-20241225143052
